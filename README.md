## Running the code.
Compile the code files `*.c` and run the executables, linux executables are already present, the files without extension are most probably executables, they can be just run directly by providing the path to them.
to compile recommended to use GCC or CLang.
```bash
$ clang ./filename.c -o filename
$ ./filename
```
or 
```bash
gcc ./filename.c -o filename
$ ./filename
```
alternatively you can use `make` 
```bash
$ make filename
$ ./filename
```
