## [B] Attempt the following:

a. A 5-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a recursive and non-recursive function to calculate the sum of digits of the 5-digit number. [Solution](./a.c)

b. A positive integer is entered through the keyboard write a program to obtain the prime factors of the number. Modity the function to sutable to obtain the prime factors recursively. [solution](./b.c)

c. Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of two successive terms give the third term. Follwoing are the first few terms of a Fibonacci sequence: [Solution](./c.c)
```
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89...
```

d. A positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a function to find the binary equivalent of this number: [Solution](./d.c)
1. Without using recursion
2. Using recursion

e. Write a recursive function to obtain the sum of first 25 natural numbers: [Solution](./e.c)

f. There are three pegs labeled A, B and C. Four disks are placed on a peg A. The bottom-most disk is largest, and disks go on decreasing in size with the topmost disk being smallest the objective of the game is to move the disks from peg A to peg C using peg B as an auxiliary peg, The rules of the game are as follows: 
1. Only one disk may be moved at a time, and it must be thee top disk on one of the pegs.
2. A largr disk should never be placed on the top of a smaller disk. 

Write a program to print the sequence in which the disks should be moved such that all disks on peg A are finally transferred to peg C. 
[Solution](./f.c)

g. If a positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a recursive function to obtain the prime factors of the number. [Solution](./g.c)
