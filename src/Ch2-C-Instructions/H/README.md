## [H] Attempt the following:

a. If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of it's digits, (Hint: Use modulus operator `%`). [Solution](./a.c)

b. if a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the number. [Solution](./b.c)

c. If lengths of three sides of a triangle are input through the keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle. [Solution](./c.c)

d. Write a program to recieve Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y) of a point and convert them into polar co-corinates (r, θ). [Solution](./d.c)

_Hint: r = sqrt(x² + y²) and θ = tan⁻¹(y / x)_
