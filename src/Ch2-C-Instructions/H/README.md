## [H] Attempt the following:

a. If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of it's digits, (Hint: Use modulus operator `%`). [Solution](./a.c)

b. if a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the number. [Solution](./b.c)

c. If lengths of three sides of a triangle are input through the keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle. [Solution](./c.c)

d. Write a program to recieve Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y) of a point and convert them into polar co-corinates (r, θ). [Solution](./d.c)

_Hint: r = sqrt(x² + y²) and θ = tan⁻¹(y / x)_

e. Write a program to recieve values of latitude `(L1, L2)` and longitude `(G1, G2)`, in degrees, of the two places on earth and output the distance `(D)` between them in nautical miles. The formula for distance in nautical miles is:
`D = 3963 cos⁻¹(sin L1 sin L2 + cos L1 cos L2 * cos(G2 - G1))`[Solution](./e.c)

f. Whind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature, and is calculated as per the following formula: 

`wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + ( 0.4275t - 35.75 ) * v⁰.¹⁶` (v^{0.16})

where t is the temperature and v is the wind velocity. write a program to recive values of t and v and calculate wind chill factor (wcf). [Solution](./f.c)

g. If value of an angle is input through the keyboard into two locations `C` and `D`. Write a program to interchange the contents of `C` and `D`. [Solution](./g.c)
