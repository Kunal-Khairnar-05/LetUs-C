## [C] Attempt the following:

a. Write a function that recieves 5 integers and returns the sum, average and standard deviation of these numbers. Call the function from `main()` and print the results in `main()`. [Solution](./a.c)

b. Write a function that recieves marks obtained by a student in 3 subjects and returns the average and percentage of these marks. Call this function from `main()` and print the results in `main()`. [Solution](./b.c)

c. Write a C function to evaluate the series

![\sin(x) = x-(x^3/3!) + (x^5 / 5!) - (x^7 / 7!) + \dots](../../../assets/ch9-c-c.png)

upto 10 terms [Solution](./c.c)

d. Given three variables `x`, `y`, `z` write a function to circularly shift their values to right. In other words if `x = 5`, `y = 8`, `z = 10`, after circular shift `y = 5`, `z = 8`, `x = 10`, Call the function with variables a, b, c to circularly shift values. [Solution](./d.c)

e. If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are denoted by `a`, `b`, and `c`, then area of traingle is given by `area = sqrt(S(S - a)(s - b)(s - c))` where `S = (a + b + c) / 2`. Write a function to calculate the area of the traingle. [Solution](./e.c)
